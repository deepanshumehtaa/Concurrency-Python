Thread Pool:
Reusing existing Threads, Because creating threads are expensive.
Also, Most of the computer OS caps the number of Thread that they can run.
And program could be crash if you will try to create more number of threads.

Why Creating Threads are Expensive ?
A: For that we need to look at the structure of Thread Pool:
    1.  components:
        1. Work Producers (tasks like Network call, i/o task, db connections, interrupts, rw to a file, etc)
        2. Job Queue (intermediate b/w producer and pool)
        3. Thread Pool (list of threads of fixed len)
    2. lot of calls to OS and OS need to allocate OS and CPU

So, ThreadPoolExecutor comes to rescue, an approach to keep up the throughput is to create & instantiate
a pool of idle threads beforehand and reuse the threads from this pool until all the threads are exhausted.
Also, the pool keeps track and manages the threads lifecycle and schedules them on the programmerâ€™s behalf
thus making the code much simpler and less buggy.

we can use 3 methods to spawn threads from ThreadPoolExecutor:
1. map(fn, *iterables, timeout = None, chunksize = 1)
2. submit(fn, *args, **kwargs) -> Future:
3. shutdown(wait = True, *, cancel_futures = False)
    i. It must be called before executor.submit() and executor.map() method else it would throw RuntimeError.
    ii. It signals the executor to free up all resources when the futures are done executing.
    iii. wait=True makes the method not to return until execution of all threads is done and resources are freed up.
    iv. cancel_futures=True then the executor will cancel all the future threads that are yet to start.


`workers` are just MAX number of running tasks on parallel threads, hence a thread is nothing but worker !
